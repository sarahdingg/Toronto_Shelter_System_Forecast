Which Model to Use?
Linear Regression:
If your goal is to predict the number of individuals moving to housing as a numeric value (e.g., 200 people).
Logistic Regression:
If your goal is to predict the likelihood or probability of an individual moving to housing (e.g., 70% chance) or classify the outcome as "Yes" or "No."
Recommendation for Your Paper:
If your outcome variable "Moved to Housing" is count data (e.g., number of individuals moved), use linear regression.
If you're modeling individual outcomes (e.g., whether a specific person moved to housing), use logistic regression.

You said:
are we predicting the trend per population group?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to predict the trend per population group (e.g., youth, families, chronic, etc.), you can incorporate population group-specific trends into your linear regression model. Here's how this could work:

Predicting Trends Per Population Group
To forecast the number of individuals "Moved to Housing" for each population group:

Outcome Variable (Dependent Variable):

moved_to_housing: The number of individuals moved to permanent housing, segmented by population_group.
Key Modifications:

Include population_group as either:
A categorical variable: Representing groups like youth, families, etc.
Separate models: Build individual linear regression models for each population group (e.g., one model for youth, another for families).
Approaches:
Option 1: Combined Model with Interaction Terms
Use a single regression model but include interaction terms to capture population-specific effects: \text{moved_to_housing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{population_group}) + \beta_2 (\text{time_step}) + \beta_3 (\text{population_group} \times \text{time_step}) + \dots
This allows you to predict trends while accounting for differences across groups.
Advantages:

Captures differences across groups in a unified model.
Simplifies comparisons between groups.
Example Predictors:

time_step: Captures overall temporal trends.
population_group: Categorical variable for group differences.
Interaction term (population_group x time_step): Captures group-specific trends.
Option 2: Separate Models for Each Population Group
Train separate linear regression models for each group:
Example: One model for youth, one for families, etc.
Predict trends within each group independently.
Advantages:

Provides group-specific predictions.
Simplifies the model structure but requires more data for each group.
Predictor Variables for Population Group Models
Whether you use one combined model or separate models, include the following predictors for each population group:

Time-Based Predictors:

time_step (captures temporal trends).
seasonality (e.g., is_winter).
Shelter Dynamics Predictors:

returned_to_shelter_last_month (group-specific).
actively_homeless_last_month (group-specific).
newly_identified (group-specific).
Demographics (if applicable):

Group-specific age and gender proportions (if available).
Which Approach Should You Choose?
Use Option 1 (Combined Model with Interaction Terms) if you want a single, unified model and have sufficient data for all groups.
Use Option 2 (Separate Models) if population groups behave very differently, and you want group-specific insights.
Let me know which approach you’d like to pursue, and I can guide you through building the model!






You said:
i think i want to do separate models, with youth and others
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
Great choice! By separating the models, you can capture the unique trends and predictors for the youth population and compare them to other groups. Here's how you can structure your analysis:

Steps for Building Separate Models
1. Split the Data:
Divide the dataset into two groups based on population_group:
Youth: Include only rows where population_group == 'Youth'.
Others: Include rows where population_group represents other categories (e.g., families, single adults, chronic).
2. Define Variables for Each Model:
Outcome Variable:
moved_to_housing: The number of individuals moved to housing within each group.
Predictor Variables:
Time-Based Predictors:

time_step: Numeric variable for time trends.
Seasonal indicators: Dummy variables for months (e.g., is_winter).
Shelter Dynamics Predictors:

returned_to_shelter_last_month: Number of individuals returning to shelter last month (group-specific).
actively_homeless_last_month: Number of individuals actively homeless last month (group-specific).
newly_identified: First-time entries into the shelter system.
Demographics Predictors (if available):

Age group proportions (specific to youth or others).
Gender proportions (specific to youth or others).
3. Train Separate Models:
Fit a linear regression model for each group:

Youth Model: Use data filtered to include only youth-related rows.
Others Model: Use data filtered to exclude youth-related rows.
Example equation for both models:

\text{moved_to_housing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{time_step}) + \beta_2 (\text{returned_to_shelter_last_month}) + \beta_3 (\text{actively_homeless_last_month}) + \dots
4. Evaluate the Models:
Use metrics like:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for assessing prediction accuracy.
Adjusted R² to evaluate how well predictors explain the variance in the outcome.
5. Compare Insights Between Models:
Look for differences in:
Trends over time (e.g., does housing success increase faster for youth?).
Key predictors (e.g., does actively_homeless_last_month have more impact for youth than others?).
Next Steps:
Filter and prepare the data for youth and other groups.
Create lagged variables and any necessary seasonal indicators.
Fit separate linear regression models for each group.
Let me know if you'd like assistance with preparing the data, coding the models, or visualizing the results!

can you help me prepare the data?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Observations from the Dataset
The dataset contains key columns for preparation, including:

Date (date(mmm-yy): A time-based column, which can be converted to a proper datetime format.
Population Group (population_group): The categorical variable used to filter for youth and others.
Outcome Variable (moved_to_housing): The target for modeling.
Potential Predictors: Variables like returned_to_shelter, actively_homeless, newly_identified, and demographic information.
Steps to Prepare the Data:
Filter by Population Group:

Create two subsets of data: one for youth and one for others (all non-youth groups).
Convert Date Format:

Transform date(mmm-yy) into a proper datetime format and extract useful features like month and year.
Create Lagged Variables:

Add lagged features for key predictors (e.g., moved_to_housing_last_month, returned_to_shelter_last_month).
Process Demographic Columns:

Normalize or convert demographic proportions into percentages.
Clean Up the population_group_percentage:

Convert percentages stored as strings (e.g., 100.0%) into numeric values.
Remove Irrelevant Columns:

Exclude columns like _id or other identifiers that don’t contribute to the analysis.
Data Preparation Implementation in Python
Here’s how we can start preparing the data:

python
Copy code
# Convert date column to datetime format
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date(mmm-yy)'], format='%b-%y')

# Filter data into youth and others
youth_data = data[data['population_group'] == 'Youth']
others_data = data[data['population_group'] != 'Youth']

# Clean population group percentage (remove % and convert to float)
data['population_group_percentage'] = data['population_group_percentage'].str.replace('%', '').astype(float)

# Create lagged variables for key predictors
for lag_var in ['moved_to_housing', 'returned_to_shelter', 'actively_homeless']:
    data[f'{lag_var}_last_month'] = data.groupby('population_group')[lag_var].shift(1)

# Remove irrelevant columns
columns_to_drop = ['_id', 'date(mmm-yy)']
data_cleaned = data.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)

# Display a sample of the cleaned data
data_cleaned.head()
Next Steps
Confirm if you'd like to add more lagged variables or handle any specific columns.
Visualize trends for youth vs. other groups.
Use the cleaned dataset to train separate linear regression models for youth and others.

why do we need lagged variables?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Lagged variables are crucial in time-series analysis and regression models when the goal is to understand how past values influence future outcomes. Here's why they are useful for your analysis:

1. Capturing Temporal Dependencies
Many outcomes, such as the number of individuals moved to housing, are influenced by past events.
For example:
If a high number of individuals were returned_to_shelter last month, this might reduce moved_to_housing this month because the system's capacity is strained.
2. Improving Predictive Power
Adding lagged variables allows the model to incorporate historical patterns, which often provide better predictions for time-dependent data.
For example:
If moved_to_housing has been increasing steadily, the lagged values will capture this trend and allow the model to predict future values more accurately.
3. Identifying Trends and Cycles
Lagged variables help the model detect recurring patterns or seasonality.
For example:
If the number of moved_to_housing decreases during winter months, the lagged variable can reflect this pattern over time.
4. Accounting for System Dynamics
In a system like Toronto’s shelter system:
"Moved to Housing" this month may depend on:
How many were "Actively Homeless" last month.
How many individuals "Returned to Shelter" last month.
The availability of housing resources, which might reflect in lagged values.
Example in Your Case
For "Moved to Housing" as the outcome, the lagged variables might help capture:

Resource allocation: If many were moved to housing last month, fewer resources may be available this month.
Shelter dynamics: If many returned to the shelter last month, the system may focus more on managing returns than transitions to housing.
When Not to Use Lagged Variables
If:

Your data doesn’t have clear temporal relationships.
Lagged variables don’t add new information (e.g., no strong correlation between past and current values).
In your case, since "Moved to Housing" depends on system dynamics that evolve monthly, lagged variables are likely to improve the model's predictive accuracy. Let me know if you'd like to test this with your data!

Key Notes
"All Population" Rows:

These rows are removed in Step 2 to avoid double-counting since they summarize other rows for each month.
Date Parsing:

The date(mmm-yy) column is converted to a proper Date object for easier time-series analysis.
Percentage Cleaning:

The population_group_percentage column, stored as a string with %, is converted to numeric values for analysis.
Irrelevant Columns:

_id and similar columns are excluded to keep only relevant data.
Handling Missing Data:

The script identifies missing values for review. You can later decide whether to impute or exclude them based on your analysis needs.
Saved Output:

The cleaned dataset is saved as cleaned_analysis_data.csv for easy re-use.

You said:
do you think only focusing on one population group would make the model too simple and too vague? would there be enough talking points to discuss about? should i include more population groups?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Focusing on only one population group (youth) has both advantages and limitations. Let’s break it down to help you decide whether to include additional groups in your model:

Advantages of Focusing on Youth Only
Depth Over Breadth:

Allows you to dive deeply into the unique challenges and trends faced by youth experiencing homelessness.
Clear focus makes it easier to draw specific insights and actionable recommendations.
Relevance to Policy or Programs:

If your goal is to inform policies targeting youth, this focused analysis will be directly applicable.
Simpler Model:

Less complexity in feature engineering, analysis, and interpretation.
Easier to validate and explain model performance.
Challenges of Focusing Only on Youth
Limited Variability in Data:

Restricting to one group might reduce the variation in predictors and outcomes, making it harder to identify significant trends or relationships.
Potential for Oversimplification:

Youth-specific trends might not provide a comprehensive view of the shelter system’s performance, limiting generalizability.
Fewer Discussion Points:

Without comparisons to other groups, the narrative might lack depth, particularly when discussing system-wide trends or disparities.
Including More Population Groups
Benefits:
Broader Perspective:

Allows you to analyze and compare trends across different groups (e.g., youth vs. families vs. chronic populations).
Adds richness to the discussion by identifying disparities or unique predictors for each group.
More Complex and Robust Model:

Increases variability in the data, potentially improving model performance and insights.
Stronger Talking Points:

Enables comparisons to discuss which groups benefit most or least from the shelter system and why.
How to Balance It:
Focus on Youth as a primary group but include others (e.g., families, chronic) for comparison.
Use interaction terms or stratified models to capture group-specific effects while keeping the narrative centered on youth.
Suggested Approach
For trend analysis: Include all population groups to show system-wide patterns and disparities.
For modeling:
Build separate models for youth and other groups (your current plan).
Alternatively, combine groups into a single model with an interaction term for population_group to analyze group-specific effects.
Discussion Points If You Include More Groups
Differences in predictors (e.g., does returned_to_shelter affect youth differently than families?).
Comparisons of system effectiveness (e.g., are youth more likely to move to housing compared to other groups?).
Highlighting disparities and suggesting tailored interventions.
If you'd like to explore this hybrid approach, I can help you adjust your dataset and model accordingly!






You said:
but the problem with the dataset is that, for each population group, there are different age groups, and so for chronic group, there are people aged from 16-24 (youth)

ChatGPT

Current Model Status
If you're applying the model to the current dataset (model_data), it predicts historical housing transitions based on the predictor values provided. If you want to see these predictions:

r
Copy code
# Generate predictions for the dataset
predictions <- predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data)

# Combine predictions with actual data
results <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predictions
  )

# View the predictions alongside actual values
head(results[, c("date", "moved_to_housing", "predicted_moved_to_housing")])
Summary
Currently, the model is predicting historical values for moved_to_housing within your dataset.
If you want it to predict future trends or test hypothetical scenarios, you’ll need to create a new dataset with projected values for the predictors.
Would you like to analyze historical predictions or extend this to forecast future trends? Let me know!

i need a table for my results section presenting the predicted results for moved_to_housing
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a table for the results section presenting the predicted results for moved_to_housing, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Generate Predictions
Use your trained model to generate predictions for moved_to_housing based on your dataset.

r
Copy code
# Generate predictions for moved_to_housing
predictions <- predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data)

# Add predictions to the dataset
results <- model_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_moved_to_housing = predictions)

# Select relevant columns for the table
results_table <- results %>%
  select(
    date,
    moved_to_housing,
    predicted_moved_to_housing
  )
Step 2: Format the Table for Presentation
Use knitr::kable() to create a nicely formatted table for your Quarto or LaTeX document.

r
Copy code
# Load the knitr library
library(knitr)

# Create the table
results_table %>%
  head(10) %>%  # Show only the first 10 rows for simplicity
  mutate(
    date = format(date, "%b %Y"),  # Format the date for better readability
    moved_to_housing = round(moved_to_housing, 1),  # Round values
    predicted_moved_to_housing = round(predicted_moved_to_housing, 1)
  ) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Predicted vs. Actual Values for `Moved to Housing`",
    col.names = c("Date", "Actual", "Predicted"),
    digits = 1,
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
Step 3: Customize the Table
You can adjust the number of rows shown (head()), format the dates, or round the values further depending on your preferences. The caption can also be customized.

Would you like to include additional columns (e.g., residuals) or modify the format further? Let me know!

If the date information is stored under a different name, use that column name instead of date in the select() function.

2. Update the Code
Replace date in the select() function with the correct column name for the date (if it exists). If there’s no date column, and you need it, you can try adding it back to the dataset if it was omitted during preprocessing.

r
Copy code
results <- model_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_moved_to_housing = predictions) %>%
  mutate(date = model_data$date) # Ensure the date column exists
3. Revised Table Code
Here’s the corrected table creation code, accounting for the possibility of different column names:

r
Copy code
# Check the column names and adjust if necessary
results_table <- results %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = round(predicted_moved_to_housing, 1),
    moved_to_housing = round(moved_to_housing, 1)
  ) %>%
  select(
    Date = date,  # Adjust column name if necessary
    Actual = moved_to_housing,
    Predicted = predicted_moved_to_housing
  )

# Present the table with knitr
library(knitr)

results_table %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Predicted vs. Actual Values for `Moved to Housing`",
    col.names = c("Date", "Actual", "Predicted"),
    digits = 1,
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" for LaTeX output
  )
Next Steps
Run the above code. If the issue persists, provide the output of colnames(results) so I can adjust the script to match your dataset structure.

The output confirms that there is no date column in your results dataset. To address this, you can add an appropriate identifier for time, if relevant, or exclude it from the table. Below is an updated script to create the table without a date column:

Updated Table Code
r
Copy code
# Select columns and format the table
results_table <- results %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = round(predicted_moved_to_housing, 1),
    moved_to_housing = round(moved_to_housing, 1)
  ) %>%
  select(
    Actual = moved_to_housing,
    Predicted = predicted_moved_to_housing
  )

# Present the table using knitr
library(knitr)

results_table %>%
  head(10) %>% # Display the first 10 rows
  kable(
    caption = "Predicted vs. Actual Values for `Moved to Housing`",
    col.names = c("Actual", "Predicted"),
    digits = 1,
    format = "markdown"  # Use "latex" for LaTeX output if required
  )
Next Steps
Run this code, and you should see a table displaying the actual and predicted values for moved_to_housing. If you need to add a time variable, you'll have to generate or retrieve it from the original dataset. Let me know if you'd like assistance with that.






You said:

i thought we are using age as a predictor variable, why is it not here?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The model you're using does include interaction terms that combine age groups with time (e.g., interaction_age_under16_time), but it does not include the raw age group variables as separate predictors. If you intended to use age groups directly as predictors (in addition to the interaction terms), the formula would need to be updated.

Here's how you can include the age group variables directly:

Updated Formula
r
Copy code
model_toronto <- lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ 
    returned_to_shelter + 
    actively_homeless + 
    newly_identified + 
    population_group_percentage + 
    ageunder16 + `age16-24` + `age25-34` + `age35-44` + `age45-54` + `age55-64` + age65over + 
    interaction_age_under16_time + interaction_age16_24_time + interaction_age25_34_time + 
    interaction_age35_44_time + interaction_age45_54_time + interaction_age55_64_time + 
    interaction_age65over_time,
  data = model_data
)
Explanation of Changes
Direct Age Group Variables: This formula explicitly includes all raw age group variables (e.g., ageunder16, age16-24, etc.) as independent predictors.
Interaction Terms: The interaction terms are still part of the formula to account for combined effects of age and time.
Next Steps
Update the formula in your script with the one above if you want to include age groups as predictors directly.
Re-run the model fitting process and inspect the new model summary.
Check whether including these variables improves the model fit (e.g., by comparing R², adjusted R², and AIC/BIC).

Yes, the code you provided predicts moved_to_housing as an aggregated outcome, combining all age groups. The model_toronto model uses predictors like returned_to_shelter, actively_homeless, and the interaction terms for age groups, but it does not separate predictions by age group. The predictions are for the total moved_to_housing across all age groups.

If you'd like to make predictions specifically for each age group, you'd need to modify the model to include an interaction term between age groups and other predictors, or filter the data for individual age groups before modeling. Let me know if you'd like to adjust your analysis to focus on age-specific predictions!






You said:
can you make it so that it shows it by year?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To aggregate the predictions and actual values of moved_to_housing by year, you can modify the code to group the data by year and compute the mean (or sum, depending on your analysis goal) for both the actual and predicted values. Here's the updated code:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Add a year column for aggregation
results <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    year = format(date, "%Y"),  # Extract the year from the date
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data)  # Generate predictions
  )

# Aggregate by year
results_by_year <- results %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    actual_moved_to_housing = mean(moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE),  # Average actual values
    predicted_moved_to_housing = mean(predicted_moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE)  # Average predicted values
  )

# Round values for better readability
results_by_year <- results_by_year %>%
  mutate(
    actual_moved_to_housing = round(actual_moved_to_housing, 1),
    predicted_moved_to_housing = round(predicted_moved_to_housing, 1)
  )

# Create the table
results_by_year %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Predicted vs. Actual Values for `Moved to Housing` by Year",
    col.names = c("Year", "Actual", "Predicted"),
    digits = 1,
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
This will group the data by year and present a table comparing the actual and predicted values of moved_to_housing for each year. Adjust the aggregation function (mean or sum) based on your reporting needs.






You said:

what do these values mean? i want it to say the actual number of individuals that moved to housing
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The values you see in the table are scaled versions of the actual and predicted values because the data was standardized (scaled) in your model_data preprocessing step. To show the actual number of individuals that moved to housing, you need to reverse the scaling process (i.e., "unscale" the data) by applying the mean and standard deviation used during scaling.

Here’s how you can adjust the code to unscale the values:

r
Copy code
# Unscale the values using the original mean and standard deviation
moved_to_housing_mean <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:center")
moved_to_housing_sd <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:scale")

results <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    year = format(date, "%Y"),
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data),
    # Unscale the values
    actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  )

# Aggregate by year
results_by_year <- results %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    actual_moved_to_housing = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled, na.rm = TRUE),
    predicted_moved_to_housing = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Round the values for better readability
results_by_year <- results_by_year %>%
  mutate(
    actual_moved_to_housing = round(actual_moved_to_housing),
    predicted_moved_to_housing = round(predicted_moved_to_housing)
  )

# Create the table
results_by_year %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Predicted vs. Actual Number of Individuals Moved to Housing by Year",
    col.names = c("Year", "Actual", "Predicted"),
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
Explanation:
Unscaling: The moved_to_housing values are unscaled using the mean (scaled:center) and standard deviation (scaled:scale) attributes that were applied during scaling.
Summation by Year: Instead of averaging, the code aggregates the total number of individuals that moved to housing by summing up the unscaled values.
Formatted Table: The resulting table now shows the total predicted and actual values in their original scale for each year.
This will display the total number of individuals moved to housing for each year, both actual and predicted.






You said:
now i want a table showing by age-group
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a table showing the actual and predicted moved_to_housing values by age group, we can adjust the code to aggregate the unscaled values by age group instead of by year. Here's how you can do it:

Code:
r
Copy code
# Unscale the values using the original mean and standard deviation
moved_to_housing_mean <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:center")
moved_to_housing_sd <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:scale")

results_by_age_group <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data),
    # Unscale the values
    actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  ) %>%
  # Select and group by age groups
  summarise(
    `Under 16` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(),
    names_to = "Age Group",
    values_to = "Actual Moved to Housing"
  )

# Round values for better readability
results_by_age_group <- results_by_age_group %>%
  mutate(`Actual Moved to Housing` = round(`Actual Moved to Housing`))

# Create the table
results_by_age_group %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Actual Number of Individuals Moved to Housing by Age Group",
    col.names = c("Age Group", "Actual Moved to Housing"),
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
Explanation:
Unscaling: Unscale the actual and predicted moved_to_housing values using the mean and standard deviation.
Weight by Age Group: For each age group, the unscaled moved_to_housing values are multiplied by the respective proportion of the population in that age group (ageunder16, age16-24, etc.) and summed to get total counts.
Reshape the Data: Convert the wide format (age group columns) into a long format to present the data in a readable table format.
Table Output: Use kable to create a neatly formatted table.
This will produce a table showing the total actual number of individuals moved to housing, separated by each age group. If you also want to include predicted values for each age group, let me know, and I’ll update the code accordingly.

Explanation:
Unscaling: Actual and predicted values for moved_to_housing are unscaled for interpretability.
Group by Year: Data is grouped by year (date), and calculations for each age group (actual and predicted) are performed.
Table Format: The table includes rows for each year and columns for actual and predicted counts, separated by age group.
Readable Year Format: The date column is reformatted to display only the year for simplicity.
Table Output:
The resulting table will look like this (example):

Year	Under 16 (Actual)	Under 16 (Predicted)	16-24 (Actual)	16-24 (Predicted)	...	65+ (Actual)	65+ (Predicted)
2018	150	145	300	290	...	50	48
2019	160	155	320	315	...	60	58

Explanation:
Unscaling: Converts scaled values for moved_to_housing back to original values for interpretability.
Year Extraction: The Year column is derived from the date column.
Group and Summarize: Data is grouped by year, and the actual and predicted counts are summed for each age group.
Table Format: The output table will display yearly aggregated values for each age group, both actual and predicted.
Example Table:
Year	Under 16 (Actual)	Under 16 (Predicted)	16-24 (Actual)	16-24 (Predicted)	...	65+ (Actual)	65+ (Predicted)
2018	1,500	1,450	3,000	2,900	...	500	480
2019	1,600	1,550	3,200	3,150	...	600	580

i dont think these values should be negative
ChatGPT said:

The negative values suggest that the scaling of the data or the way the aggregation was done needs adjustment. Here are a few steps to correct the issue:

Verify Scaling and Unscaling: Ensure that the unscaling of moved_to_housing and its predicted values uses the correct center and scale attributes derived from the original data. The formula should be:

r
Copy code
unscaled_value = (scaled_value * scale) + center
Check Aggregation: When summing across age groups, negative values may arise if the moved_to_housing data has been incorrectly transformed. Ensure that each age group's contribution is scaled correctly.

Updated Code:
Here’s the updated code that ensures proper unscaling and correct aggregation:

r
Copy code
# Unscale moved_to_housing values
moved_to_housing_mean <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:center")
moved_to_housing_sd <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:scale")

results_by_age_group_year <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data),
    # Unscale the values
    actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  ) %>%
  mutate(Year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%  # Extract year from date
  group_by(Year) %>%  # Group by year
  summarise(
    `Under 16 (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Under 16 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24 (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34 (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44 (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54 (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64 (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+ (Actual)` = sum(actual_moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+ (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Create the table using knitr
results_by_age_group_year %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Yearly Actual vs. Predicted Number of Individuals Moved to Housing by Age Group",
    col.names = c("Year", colnames(results_by_age_group_year)[-1]),
    format = "markdown",  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
    digits = 1
  )
Steps Taken:
Proper Unscaling: The scaled values are converted back to their original scale using the formula unscaled_value = (scaled_value * scale) + center.
Validation: Double-check the attributes scaled:center and scaled:scale to ensure they match the original data.
Aggregation: The sum is applied to the unscaled values weighted by the proportion of the population in each age group.
Expected Output:
The table should now display positive and realistic values for each age group’s actual and predicted counts of moved_to_housing.

thry are still negative
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the values are still negative, this indicates there might be an issue with either the unscaling process or the interpretation of the scaled values. Let’s break this down carefully and debug step by step:

Steps to Fix:
Verify Scaling Attributes: Double-check the scaled:center and scaled:scale values. These attributes must match the original data’s mean and standard deviation.

r
Copy code
attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:center")
attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:scale")
Check the Scaled Data: Print a sample of moved_to_housing to verify whether it’s scaled correctly.

r
Copy code
head(model_data$moved_to_housing)
Explicitly Reset Scaling: Manually apply the unscaling formula:

r
Copy code
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  )
Ensure the Data is Not Overwritten: Verify that moved_to_housing is the scaled value and not accidentally overwritten with unscaled data at some point.

Inspect Weighted Aggregation: Ensure that age group proportions (ageunder16, age16-24, etc.) are positive and sum correctly. If not, adjust these values:

r
Copy code
model_data %>%
  summarise(across(c(ageunder16, `age16-24`, `age25-34`, `age35-44`, `age45-54`, `age55-64`, age65over), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
Updated Aggregation Code:
This ensures proper unscaling and weighted aggregation for each age group:

r
Copy code
# Unscale moved_to_housing values
moved_to_housing_mean <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:center")
moved_to_housing_sd <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:scale")

model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  )

# Aggregate by year and age group
results_by_age_group_year <- model_data %>%
  mutate(Year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    `Under 16 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Under 16 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+ (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+ (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Display results using knitr
results_by_age_group_year %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Yearly Actual vs. Predicted Number of Individuals Moved to Housing by Age Group",
    col.names = c("Year", colnames(results_by_age_group_year)[-1]),
    format = "markdown",  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
    digits = 1
  )
Debug Checklist:
Ensure Scaling Attributes: Validate moved_to_housing scaling attributes.
Inspect Weighting: Confirm age* columns represent proportions and are positive.
Validate Results: Print unscaled values and intermediate summaries to ensure correctness:
r
Copy code
summary(model_data$moved_to_housing_unscaled)
summary(model_data$predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled)
This should resolve the issue with negative values and produce a realistic table.

The error indicates that the column predicted_moved_to_housing does not exist in model_data. This could be because predictions were not added back to the model_data before attempting to unscale the values.

Fix:
Ensure that predictions are generated and appended to the model_data before unscaling. Update your script as follows:

r
Copy code
# Step 1: Generate predictions for `moved_to_housing`
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data))

# Step 2: Retrieve scaling attributes
moved_to_housing_mean <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:center")
moved_to_housing_sd <- attr(model_data$moved_to_housing, "scaled:scale")

# Step 3: Unscale both actual and predicted values
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  )

# Step 4: Aggregate by year and age group
results_by_age_group_year <- model_data %>%
  mutate(Year = format(date, "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    `Under 16 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Under 16 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * ageunder16, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `16-24 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age16-24`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `25-34 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age25-34`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `35-44 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age35-44`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `45-54 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age45-54`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64 (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `55-64 (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * `age55-64`, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+ (Actual)` = sum(moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    `65+ (Predicted)` = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled * age65over, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 5: Display results as a table
results_by_age_group_year %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Yearly Actual vs. Predicted Number of Individuals Moved to Housing by Age Group",
    col.names = c("Year", colnames(results_by_age_group_year)[-1]),
    format = "markdown",  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
    digits = 1
  )
Key Updates:
Add Predictions: Ensure predicted_moved_to_housing is added to model_data.
Unscale Values: Use scaling attributes correctly after predictions are made.
Aggregate Correctly: Ensure aggregation uses unscaled values.
This should resolve the issue and produce correct, non-negative values. Let me know if further assistance is needed!

#### Step 5: Save Updated Model Data ####
saveRDS(model_data, "models/model_toronto.rds")
Key Updates:
Unscaling Outcome Variables:
Calculated moved_to_housing_mean and moved_to_housing_sd to reverse scaling for both moved_to_housing and its predictions.
Predicted and Actual Values:
Added moved_to_housing_unscaled for the unscaled actual values.
Added predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled for unscaled predictions.
Updated Model Data:
Saved the new model_data to include both scaled and unscaled variables.
This ensures you can directly use the unscaled values for generating tables and visualizations in your QMD file.

The warning message, "prediction from a rank-deficient fit may be misleading," typically occurs when the design matrix of the model is rank-deficient. This means there is multicollinearity or redundant predictors in your model. Here's how you can address this:

Steps to Fix the Issue
Check for Multicollinearity:

Use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify predictors that are highly collinear.

Remove Redundant Predictors:

If certain predictors are highly correlated, you can remove one of the correlated variables or create a composite variable.
Re-fit the Model:

Refit the model after removing problematic predictors or addressing multicollinearity.
Verify the Model:

Check the summary of the model again to confirm that the warning is resolved.
Revised Model Code with Checks
Here's an updated version of your model code with additional checks and adjustments:

r
Copy code
#### Step 1: Check Multicollinearity ####
library(car)
vif_results <- vif(lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ 
    returned_to_shelter + 
    actively_homeless + 
    newly_identified + 
    population_group_percentage + 
    ageunder16 + `age16-24` + `age25-34` + `age35-44` + `age45-54` + `age55-64` + age65over + 
    interaction_age_under16_time + interaction_age16_24_time + interaction_age25_34_time + 
    interaction_age35_44_time + interaction_age45_54_time + interaction_age55_64_time + 
    interaction_age65over_time,
  data = model_data
))

print(vif_results)

#### Step 2: Update Model to Address Multicollinearity ####
# If VIF is high for certain predictors, remove them. Example:
model_toronto <- lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ 
    returned_to_shelter + 
    actively_homeless + 
    newly_identified + 
    population_group_percentage + 
    interaction_age25_34_time + 
    interaction_age35_44_time + 
    interaction_age45_54_time + 
    interaction_age65over_time,
  data = model_data
)

#### Step 3: Add Predictions ####
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = model_data),
    moved_to_housing_unscaled = (moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean,
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  )

#### Step 4: Save the Updated Model Data ####
saveRDS(model_data, "models/model_toronto_updated.rds")
Next Steps:
Run the VIF check to identify problematic variables.
Simplify your model by removing redundant predictors.
Refit and test the model.
Verify that the warning is resolved when generating predictions.
This process ensures a more stable and interpretable model.

Certainly! You can adapt the structure from the provided example while keeping your existing model script intact. Here’s how you can modify your results section script to follow the example and display predicted values for the moved_to_housing variable:

Updated Script for Predicted Values
r
Copy code
# Load the cleaned analysis data and model
library(arrow)
library(dplyr)

# Load the cleaned data
cleaned_data <- arrow::read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Load the saved model
model_toronto <- readRDS("models/model_toronto.rds")

# Make predictions
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = cleaned_data)
  )

# Aggregate predictions by year
results <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(year = format(as.Date(date), "%Y")) %>%  # Extract the year from the date
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    ActualMovedToHousing = sum(moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE),
    PredictedMovedToHousing = sum(predicted_moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Present the results in a table
library(knitr)

results %>%
  mutate(
    ActualMovedToHousing = round(ActualMovedToHousing, 0),  # Round to whole numbers
    PredictedMovedToHousing = round(PredictedMovedToHousing, 0)  # Round to whole numbers
  ) %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Predicted vs. Actual Values for `Moved to Housing` by Year",
    col.names = c("Year", "Actual", "Predicted"),
    format = "markdown"  # Use "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
Output Example Table
Year	Actual	Predicted
2018	1500	1400
2019	1600	1550
2020	1700	1650
2021	1800	1750
2022	1900	1850
2023	2000	1950
Notes:
This script retains the existing model structure and calculates aggregated predictions for moved_to_housing by year.
You can adjust the mutate and summarise steps to match your dataset structure or additional requirements.

This error occurs because the predict function is being applied to an object of a class that doesn't match what the function expects. Most likely, the issue is that model_toronto is not correctly assigned as a linear model (lm) object, or there is a mismatch between the structure of cleaned_data and what predict expects.

Steps to Fix:
Verify model_toronto: Make sure that model_toronto is an object created by the lm() function. You can check its structure using:

r
Copy code
str(model_toronto)
If model_toronto is not an lm object, you might need to re-fit the model using:

r
Copy code
model_toronto <- lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ 
    returned_to_shelter + 
    actively_homeless + 
    newly_identified + 
    population_group_percentage + 
    ageunder16 + `age16-24` + `age25-34` + `age35-44` + `age45-54` + `age55-64` + age65over + 
    interaction_age_under16_time + interaction_age16_24_time + interaction_age25_34_time + 
    interaction_age35_44_time + interaction_age45_54_time + interaction_age55_64_time + 
    interaction_age65over_time,
  data = model_data
)
Verify cleaned_data: Ensure that cleaned_data contains all the variables specified in the model formula. Missing variables or mismatched column names will cause this error. Use:

r
Copy code
colnames(cleaned_data)
Compare the output with the predictors in the formula and ensure all are present.

Run the Predictions Again: After verifying the above, rerun the predictions:

r
Copy code
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = cleaned_data)
  )
If Scaling Is Used: If your model involves scaled predictors, ensure the new data (cleaned_data) is scaled the same way. For instance:

r
Copy code
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ scale(.)))
Alternatively, unscale the predicted values after running predict:

r
Copy code
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = predicted_moved_to_housing * sd(model_data$moved_to_housing) + mean(model_data$moved_to_housing)
  )
Recheck Model Assignment and Data:
If the error persists, recheck how model_toronto and cleaned_data are being generated. Let me know if you need further clarification!

This error indicates that there are mismatches in variable types between the model_data used to train the lm model and the cleaned_data being used for prediction. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Steps to Fix
Verify the Data Types: Check the data types of the variables in both model_data and cleaned_data. Ensure they match for all predictors. For example:

r
Copy code
str(model_data)
str(cleaned_data)
Convert Variable Types: If there are discrepancies, adjust the types in cleaned_data to match model_data. For example:

Convert factors to numeric or vice versa.
Ensure numeric columns remain numeric.
Example:

r
Copy code
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(
    across(c(returned_to_shelter, actively_homeless, newly_identified, population_group_percentage,
             ageunder16, `age16-24`, `age25-34`, `age35-44`, `age45-54`, `age55-64`, age65over,
             interaction_age_under16_time, interaction_age16_24_time, interaction_age25_34_time,
             interaction_age35_44_time, interaction_age45_54_time, interaction_age55_64_time,
             interaction_age65over_time), as.numeric)
  )
Ensure Consistent Scaling: If the original model_data was scaled, ensure the same scaling process is applied to cleaned_data. Use the means and standard deviations from model_data to scale cleaned_data.

Example:

r
Copy code
scaled_cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(across(
    where(is.numeric),
    ~ (. - mean(model_data[[cur_column()]], na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(model_data[[cur_column()]], na.rm = TRUE)
  ))
Reattempt Prediction: After ensuring the variable types match and the scaling is consistent, reattempt prediction:

r
Copy code
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = cleaned_data))
Unscale Predicted Values (Optional): If scaling was applied, unscale the predicted values:

r
Copy code
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * sd(model_data$moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE)) +
                                          mean(model_data$moved_to_housing, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
Debugging Tip: If the issue persists, isolate the problematic variables by comparing the structure of model_data and cleaned_data column by column. For instance:

r
Copy code
sapply(model_data, class)
sapply(cleaned_data, class)
Identify and fix any mismatches.

Let me know if you encounter further issues!






You said:


why does my model data look like that
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue lies in the scaling process in your model_data. When you use mutate(across(where(is.numeric), scale)), this scales every numeric column in your dataset, including the outcome variable (moved_to_housing) and the predictor variables. This changes their values into standardized z-scores, which aren't compatible with the raw cleaned_data values.

Fix for model_data
To resolve this, ensure that only the predictor variables are scaled, leaving the outcome variable (moved_to_housing) in its original form. Here's how you can update your script:

r
Copy code
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
library(readr)

# Load the cleaned analysis data
analysis_data <- arrow::read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Step 1: Select relevant columns for modeling
model_data <- analysis_data %>%
  select(
    date,
    returned_to_shelter,
    moved_to_housing,
    actively_homeless,
    newly_identified,
    ageunder16, `age16-24`, `age25-34`, `age35-44`, `age45-54`, `age55-64`, age65over,
    interaction_age_under16_time, interaction_age16_24_time, interaction_age25_34_time,
    interaction_age35_44_time, interaction_age45_54_time, interaction_age55_64_time,
    interaction_age65over_time,
    population_group_percentage
  )

# Step 2: Scale only predictor variables, excluding the outcome variable
predictor_cols <- setdiff(names(model_data), c("moved_to_housing", "date"))
model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(across(
    all_of(predictor_cols), 
    scale, 
    .names = "scaled_{.col}"
  ))

# Step 3: Drop unscaled predictors and retain the scaled versions for the model
model_data <- model_data %>%
  select(date, moved_to_housing, starts_with("scaled_"))

# Step 4: Fit the model using scaled predictors
model_toronto <- lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ . - date,  # Use all predictors except `date`
  data = model_data
)

# Step 5: Save the prepared model data into an RDS file
saveRDS(model_data, "models/model_toronto.rds")
Explanation
Scaling Predictor Variables Only: The code identifies all predictor variables (excluding moved_to_housing and date) and applies scaling to only these columns.
New Scaled Columns: The scaled versions of predictors are saved with a scaled_ prefix to differentiate them.
Final model_data: Only includes moved_to_housing, date, and the scaled predictors.
After this change, your model_data will retain the outcome variable (moved_to_housing) in its raw form, while predictors will be scaled appropriately. The model should now align with your cleaned_data during prediction.






You said:
why do i need to scale the predictor variables anyways
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You don’t necessarily need to scale predictor variables unless there's a specific reason to do so. Here are some situations where scaling is beneficial and why it may or may not be necessary in your case:

Reasons to Scale Predictor Variables:
For Algorithms Sensitive to Magnitudes:

Scaling is crucial for models like support vector machines (SVMs), principal component analysis (PCA), or regularized regression (e.g., ridge or lasso). These algorithms use distance or magnitude (e.g., Euclidean distance, variance), so predictors on different scales can disproportionately affect the results.
In linear regression (like your case), this is not required for correct functioning since the regression coefficients adjust for the scales.
For Interpretability in Regularized Models:

Regularization methods (e.g., ridge, lasso) penalize large coefficients, and unscaled predictors might cause unfair penalization for variables with large values. Scaling ensures that predictors are treated equally during regularization.
To Improve Numerical Stability:

When the predictor variables have vastly different ranges, this could lead to numerical instability in computations (e.g., matrix inversion). This is less of a problem with modern computational tools and is typically a concern with datasets having extreme differences in scales.
To Compare Coefficients Across Predictors:

In standard linear regression, scaling is helpful if you want to directly compare the effect sizes of predictors since coefficients represent changes relative to one unit of the variable. Scaling puts all predictors on the same standardized scale, making comparisons more straightforward.
Why Scaling Might Not Be Necessary in Your Case:
Linear Regression Handles Scales Automatically:

Linear regression does not require scaling because the coefficients are directly proportional to the scale of the predictors. If you are not doing regularization or using distance-based methods, scaling is optional.
Interpreting Results in Original Units:

If you want your coefficients and predictions to be interpretable in the original units of the predictors (e.g., actual number of people moved to housing), scaling will hinder this interpretability.
No Need for Regularization:

If your model doesn’t use regularization (like ridge or lasso), you don't have to scale your predictors. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression works fine without scaling.
What You Should Do:
Skip Scaling: If interpretability in the original units matters to you, don't scale the predictor variables. This way, your coefficients will reflect the impact of a one-unit change in each variable directly in the context of the original dataset.
Scale Only If Necessary: If you later decide to use models or methods that are sensitive to scaling (like regularization or PCA), you can scale your data then.
Updated model_data Script Without Scaling
Here’s how your model_data script would look if you choose not to scale:

r
Copy code
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
library(readr)

# Load the cleaned analysis data
analysis_data <- arrow::read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Step 1: Select relevant columns for modeling (no scaling)
model_data <- analysis_data %>%
  select(
    date,
    returned_to_shelter,
    moved_to_housing,
    actively_homeless,
    newly_identified,
    ageunder16, `age16-24`, `age25-34`, `age35-44`, `age45-54`, `age55-64`, age65over,
    interaction_age_under16_time, interaction_age16_24_time, interaction_age25_34_time,
    interaction_age35_44_time, interaction_age45_54_time, interaction_age55_64_time,
    interaction_age65over_time,
    population_group_percentage
  )

# Step 2: Fit the model directly without scaling
model_toronto <- lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ 
    returned_to_shelter + 
    actively_homeless + 
    newly_identified + 
    population_group_percentage + 
    ageunder16 + `age16-24` + `age25-34` + `age35-44` + `age45-54` + `age55-64` + age65over + 
    interaction_age_under16_time + interaction_age16_24_time + interaction_age25_34_time + 
    interaction_age35_44_time + interaction_age45_54_time + interaction_age55_64_time + 
    interaction_age65over_time,
  data = model_data
)

# Step 3: Save the model data without scaling
saveRDS(model_data, "models/model_toronto.rds")
With this approach:

Your predictors remain in their original units, ensuring that predictions and coefficients are interpretable without rescaling.
This avoids unnecessary transformations unless your modeling approach requires scaling.

    ),
    digits = 1,
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
Explanation:
Predictions:

predict() is used to generate predictions for moved_to_housing based on the model_toronto linear regression model.
Aggregation:

The results are grouped by year using group_by(year), and the actual and predicted values are summed for each age group.
Summarisation:

The summation for each age group is performed using sum(age_group * outcome_variable). This aggregates the contribution of individuals within each age group to the total moved_to_housing count for the year.
Table Creation:

The kable() function is used to create a clean table that shows yearly actual vs. predicted values by age group.
Columns:

Columns for each age group are included in the table, showing both actual and predicted values.
Output:
A table displaying yearly totals for actual and predicted numbers of individuals moved to housing for each age group. This format ensures clarity and interpretability of the results in your paper.

mutate(across()):

The across() function applies formatting to all numeric columns except year.
Example of Formatted Numbers:

1000 → 1,000
1000000 → 1,000,000
Output:
The table will now display values with commas for easier readability, while the year column remains unformatted.

Here is the R code to create a bar graph visualizing the predicted results by age group for each year:

# Assuming `results_table` contains yearly aggregated data for predictions by age group
# Example structure:
# Year | Age Group | Predicted Count
# 2018 | Under 16  | 1818
# 2018 | 16-24     | 1691

  Year = rep(2018:2024, each = 7),
  Age_Group = rep(c("Under 16", "16-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"), times = 7),
  Predicted_Count = c(

You said:
can you write me a paragraph justifying the use of this model for the purpose of my paper
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This model was chosen for its ability to estimate the relationship between key predictors and the outcome variable, the number of individuals moving to housing. By incorporating predictors such as returned to shelter, actively homeless, newly identified, population group percentage, and age group distributions, the model captures both temporal trends and demographic nuances that influence housing transitions. The inclusion of interaction terms between age groups and time ensures that age-specific dynamics are appropriately modeled over the study period, providing a more detailed understanding of how various subpopulations respond to housing interventions.

The use of linear regression aligns with the goal of the analysis: to generate interpretable coefficients that quantify the association between predictors and the outcome, allowing policymakers and stakeholders to identify factors contributing to housing outcomes. Furthermore, the model’s ability to predict future outcomes based on historical data provides a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of current policies and planning future interventions. This makes it an appropriate and practical choice for examining the Toronto shelter system’s performance in reducing homelessness and achieving housing transitions across diverse demographic groups.

The linear regression model presented in this study is the most suitable framework for predicting the number of individuals transitioning to housing within Toronto's shelter system. The outcome variable, moved_to_housing, reflects the monthly transitions, capturing temporal and demographic variations across the system. The model includes predictors such as returned_to_shelter, actively_homeless, newly_identified, and the proportion of population groups, along with age-group specific variables and their interactions with time. This structure allows the model to incorporate both aggregate trends and age-specific dynamics, ensuring a detailed representation of how different population subgroups contribute to housing outcomes.

Linear regression was chosen for its interpretability, providing clear coefficients that quantify the relationships between predictors and housing transitions. This is particularly useful for policymakers seeking actionable insights into the factors driving transitions to housing. The inclusion of interaction terms ensures that variations across demographic subgroups are adequately captured, while the incorporation of historical data facilitates forecasting.

While alternative models, such as logistic regression or machine learning approaches, could be considered, these methods may either oversimplify or overly complicate the analysis for the study's scope. The linear regression approach strikes a balance between simplicity and detail, making it well-suited to evaluate system performance and inform targeted interventions.

give me model assumptions for our model, here is an example of formatting and expectation:
In order to ensure the validity and reliability of our Bayesian models for predicting voter support percentages for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, we establish several key assumptions that guide the modeling process:

- **Linearity in the Log-Odds**: The relationship between predictor variables (end_date and state) and the log-odds of the outcome variable (percentage of support) is linear. To account for non-linear trends over time, nature splines are used. 
- **Independence**: The outcome for each polling observation is assumed to be independent of others. Each poll represents a distinct sample of voter sentiment at a specific time and location. 
- **Appropriate Distribution for Proportions**: Since the model predicts support percentages (bounded between 0 and 100), a Beta distribution with a logit link is applied, which is ideal for data that are restricted to this range.
- **Random Effects**: To capture variation across states, state-level random effects are included, allowing each state to have its unique baseline level of support, acknowledging regional political differences
- **Prior Distributions**: The model uses weakly informative priors for the intercept and coefficients, which helps in generating stable estimates and reducing the influence of outliers or unusual polling data.

ChatGPT
In order to ensure the validity and reliability of our linear regression model for predicting the number of individuals transitioning to housing (moved_to_housing) within Toronto's shelter system, we establish several key assumptions that guide the modeling process:

Linearity: The relationship between the predictor variables (e.g., returned_to_shelter, actively_homeless, newly_identified, and age-group interactions) and the outcome variable (moved_to_housing) is assumed to be linear. This allows the model to interpret the effect of each predictor as a constant change in moved_to_housing.

Independence: Observations are assumed to be independent of one another, meaning that the outcome of housing transitions for one time period or subgroup does not influence others.

Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals is assumed to remain constant across all levels of predicted values. This ensures that the model performs equally well across different ranges of predicted values.

Normality of Residuals: The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) are assumed to be normally distributed. This assumption ensures the reliability of significance tests for coefficients.

Absence of Multicollinearity: The predictor variables are assumed to be independent of one another. High multicollinearity would make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor on the outcome.

Exclusion of Omitted Variable Bias: The model assumes that all relevant predictors influencing moved_to_housing have been included, and no significant predictors are missing, which could bias the results.

These assumptions are necessary to ensure that the model provides reliable and interpretable estimates for the factors influencing transitions to housing. Regular diagnostic checks, such as residual plots and multicollinearity tests, were conducted to verify the adherence to these assumptions.

The table appears to be correct in its formatting, but the values may need verification to ensure accuracy. Let’s revisit the steps to calculate the performance metrics to ensure no errors have occurred in the process:

R-squared and Adjusted R-squared: These are directly extracted from the summary(model_toronto_train) output for the training set.

AIC and BIC: These are calculated using the AIC() and BIC() functions on the trained model.

RMSE: This is calculated from the residuals on the test data:

r
Copy code
RMSE = sqrt(mean((actual_values - predicted_values)^2, na.rm = TRUE))
Ensure that the actual and predicted values (moved_to_housing and predicted_moved_to_housing) are correctly matched.

To diagnose any potential issue:

Verify Data Types: Ensure that both moved_to_housing and predicted_moved_to_housing are numeric in test_data.

r
Copy code
str(test_data)
Inspect Metrics Calculation: Print intermediate values for debugging:

r
Copy code
print(summary(model_toronto_train)$r.squared)
print(summary(model_toronto_train)$adj.r.squared)
print(AIC(model_toronto_train))
print(BIC(model_toronto_train))
print(sqrt(mean((test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing)^2, na.rm = TRUE)))
Check Sample Size: Verify that both training and testing sets have sufficient data:

r
Copy code
nrow(train_data)
nrow(test_data)
Re-run the Model: If the above checks don't reveal issues, re-run the entire model training and testing process.

If the issue persists, please provide the debug output for further assistance.

The training and test data sizes appear reasonable for your model, with 57 observations in the training set and 25 in the test set. Given this distribution, the issue with the metrics is unlikely due to insufficient data. Let’s verify the calculations for the metrics to ensure correctness.

Here is an updated and verified script for calculating the metrics and displaying them in a properly formatted table:

    round(summary(model_toronto_train)$adj.r.squared, 3),
    round(AIC(model_toronto_train), 3),
    round(BIC(model_toronto_train), 3),
    round(sqrt(mean((test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing)^2, na.rm = TRUE)), 3)
  )
)

# Display the table using knitr

kable(
  model_performance,
  caption = "Model Performance Metrics: Out-of-Sample Testing",
  col.names = c("Metric", "Value"),
  format = "markdown"  # Use "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
)
Debugging Steps:
Ensure predicted_moved_to_housing is in test_data: Verify that predictions have been added correctly to test_data:

r
Copy code
str(test_data)
Check Residual Calculation: Ensure that the residuals (actual - predicted) are computed accurately:

r
Copy code
residuals <- test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing
print(residuals)
Re-run AIC and BIC: Confirm these values by directly computing:

r
Copy code
print(AIC(model_toronto_train))
print(BIC(model_toronto_train))
If the table still looks odd, let me know the debug outputs, and we can refine further.

everything looks right except for RMSE
ChatGPT said:

If the RMSE value appears incorrect, it might stem from how the residuals were computed or scaled. Let’s recheck and recompute the RMSE to ensure accuracy.

Here’s the updated script for recalculating RMSE:

r
Copy code
# Ensure predictions are added to test_data
test_data <- test_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = test_data))

# Compute RMSE
rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing)^2, na.rm = TRUE))

# Update the performance metrics table
model_performance <- tibble(
  Metric = c("R-squared", "Adjusted R-squared", "AIC", "BIC", "RMSE"),
  Value = c(
    round(summary(model_toronto_train)$r.squared, 3),
    round(summary(model_toronto_train)$adj.r.squared, 3),
    round(AIC(model_toronto_train), 3),
    round(BIC(model_toronto_train), 3),
    round(rmse, 3)
  )
)

# Display the table using knitr
kable(
  model_performance,
  caption = "Model Performance Metrics: Out-of-Sample Testing",
  col.names = c("Metric", "Value"),
  format = "markdown"  # Use "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
)
Steps to Verify:
Recheck Residuals: Ensure residuals are calculated correctly:

r
Copy code
residuals <- test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing
print(residuals)
Scaling Adjustments: If the outcome variable was scaled, unscale predictions and recalculate RMSE:

r
Copy code
test_data <- test_data %>%
  mutate(
    predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled = (predicted_moved_to_housing * moved_to_housing_sd) + moved_to_housing_mean
  )
rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing_unscaled)^2, na.rm = TRUE))
Verify Output: Confirm the RMSE calculation reflects the original data scale. This ensures alignment with other model metrics.

The error suggests that the test_data object does not exist in the environment where the Quarto document is being rendered. To fix this:

Ensure test_data is created earlier in the script: Make sure the code that creates the test_data object is included in the Quarto document, either in a previous chunk or imported from a script. You likely split the dataset into train_data and test_data, so ensure that step is explicitly included.

Include the data splitting logic in the Quarto document:

r
Copy code
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
train_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(model_data)), size = 0.7 * nrow(model_data))
train_data <- model_data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- model_data[-train_indices, ]
Place the above chunk before any references to test_data: Ensure this chunk is evaluated before the chunk that calculates predictions or RMSE for test_data.

Check the environment settings in Quarto: If you're running the document interactively (e.g., in RStudio), verify that all necessary objects are defined in the environment or are being sourced/loaded in the document.

After ensuring test_data is correctly defined, you can re-render the document. Let me know if you encounter further issues!






You said:

how come this code generates the metrics?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The code you provided is for summarizing the coefficients and standard errors of two linear models (lm_model_trump and lm_model_harris) using the modelsummary package. It does not calculate or present model performance metrics like AIC, BIC, RMSE, R², or Adjusted R². Here's a breakdown of why this happens:

Purpose of modelsummary:

The modelsummary function is designed to summarize and display model coefficients, not performance metrics.
It focuses on displaying predictors (PollScore, PollRecency, etc.) along with their estimates and errors.
Coefficients and Statistics Display:

The statistic = "std.error" argument specifies that standard errors should be displayed alongside coefficients.
The coef_map maps the model's coefficient names to more readable labels.
Performance Metrics:

Metrics like AIC, BIC, RMSE, and R² are not calculated or displayed by this code.
These metrics are calculated through other functions, like summary(lm_model), AIC(lm_model), or manually using residuals for RMSE.
If you want to add performance metrics to the table created by this code, you need to extract those metrics separately and include them in the table manually. For example:

r
Copy code
# Extract performance metrics for one of the models
model_metrics <- tibble(
  Metric = c("R-squared", "Adjusted R-squared", "AIC", "BIC", "RMSE"),
  Value = c(
    summary(lm_model_trump)$r.squared,
    summary(lm_model_trump)$adj.r.squared,
    AIC(lm_model_trump),
    BIC(lm_model_trump),
    sqrt(mean(residuals(lm_model_trump)^2))
  )
)

# Display the metrics table
model_metrics %>%

write a paragraph explaining the results, here is an example: 
displays overview of the percentage of support for Trump and Harris by each battleground state. It provides us with a high level understanding of the current voter dynamic. The percentages of support for Trump and Harris are aggregated averages of all **'pct'** data points for Trump and Harris in each state. By comparing the percentage of support for Trump and Harris, we can determine the candidate that has a leading advantage in winning each state. For example, Trump has 49.2% support in Arizona while Harris has 46.8% support, which means Trump has won the state of Arizona.

The table provides an overview of the yearly actual and predicted number of individuals who moved to housing within the Toronto shelter system. These values are aggregated by year, offering a high-level understanding of the system's performance in facilitating transitions to permanent housing. The actual values represent the observed outcomes from the dataset, while the predicted values are derived from the linear regression model developed for this analysis. By comparing the actual and predicted values, we can assess the model's accuracy in approximating real-world outcomes. For example, in 2023, the model predicted 3,888 individuals moved to housing, closely matching the observed value of 3,964, indicating strong alignment between predicted and actual trends. This comparison highlights the model's utility in understanding and forecasting housing transitions over time.

explain the bar graph along with the table, these two convey the same message just one in a table one in a bar graph
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The table and the bar graph provide a detailed overview of the yearly actual and predicted counts of individuals moved to housing, categorized by age group. Both representations summarize the model's ability to align its predictions with the observed data.

Table Explanation:
The table presents numerical values for actual and predicted counts of individuals moved to housing from 2018 to 2024, divided by age groups: "Under 16," "16-24," "25-34," "35-44," "45-54," "55-64," and "65+." Each cell displays the corresponding yearly total. The model's predictions are consistently close to the actual values across all age groups, with minimal deviations, which suggests that the model performs well in capturing the trends within the data.

For instance:

In 2023, the actual count for the "Under 16" group is 2,161,478, while the predicted count is 2,131,127.
Similarly, for the "65+" group, the actual count is 1,405,676, and the predicted count is 1,394,867.
Bar Graph Explanation:
The bar graph visually represents the same data, allowing for a quick comparison between actual (blue bars) and predicted (red bars) values for each age group and year. The grouped bars for each age range highlight how closely the predictions align with the actual observations.

Key observations from the graph:

The model demonstrates strong agreement with the actual data, as the heights of the blue and red bars are nearly identical across all age groups and years.
Slight variations are visible in certain age groups (e.g., "16-24" and "65+"), which could point to areas where model accuracy could be further refined.
Combined Significance:
Together, the table and the bar graph validate the model's predictive performance across different age groups and years. The table provides precise numbers, while the bar graph offers a visual snapshot, making it easier to identify trends and discrepancies at a glance. Both representations support the conclusion that the model is effective in forecasting the number of individuals moved to housing by age group over time.

how do i fix this during rendering
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This error occurs because the object test_data is not available in the environment during rendering. To resolve this, you need to ensure that the object is created or loaded within the scope of your .qmd file before it is used. Here's how you can fix it:

Ensure test_data is created or loaded:

If test_data is generated by splitting another dataset, include the code for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets in the .qmd file before using test_data.
If test_data is loaded from an external file, include the code for loading the file in the .qmd file.
Example:

r
Copy code
# Ensure this is included at the start of the `.qmd` file or before `test_data` is used
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(model_data), size = 0.7 * nrow(model_data))
train_data <- model_data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- model_data[-train_indices, ]
Scope consistency:

Ensure that test_data is defined in the same code chunk or an earlier chunk in the .qmd file.
Verify that the chunk where test_data is defined has eval = TRUE.
Debugging during rendering:

Add a debugging step to check whether test_data exists and is populated before the mutate line.
Example:

r
Copy code
if (!exists("test_data")) {
    stop("test_data is not defined. Please ensure it is created or loaded.")
}
Clear environment assumptions:

When using R Markdown or Quarto, avoid assuming that objects exist in the environment unless explicitly defined in the document.
Consider saving test_data to a file in a prior script and then loading it in the .qmd file.
Example:

r
Copy code
# Save test_data in a prior script
saveRDS(test_data, "data/test_data.rds")

# Load test_data in the .qmd file
test_data <- readRDS("data/test_data.rds")
Reproducibility:

Run the entire .qmd file from start to finish to ensure all objects and dependencies are properly initialized.
After ensuring that test_data is properly defined and available, try rendering the document again. If the issue persists, check for typos or inconsistencies in variable naming.

This error indicates that the object model_data is not found in your rendering environment. This often happens if the object is defined in your interactive R session but not created or loaded explicitly within the .qmd file.

Steps to Fix the Error:
Ensure model_data is Defined:

Include the script for creating or loading model_data in your .qmd file.
Example:

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)

# Load the cleaned analysis data
analysis_data <- arrow::read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Define `model_data`
model_data <- analysis_data %>%
  select(
    date,
    returned_to_shelter,
    moved_to_housing,
    actively_homeless,
    newly_identified,
    ageunder16, `age16-24`, `age25-34`, `age35-44`, `age45-54`, `age55-64`, age65over,
    interaction_age_under16_time, interaction_age16_24_time, interaction_age25_34_time,
    interaction_age35_44_time, interaction_age45_54_time, interaction_age55_64_time,
    interaction_age65over_time,
    population_group_percentage
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(
    where(is.numeric),
    scale
  ))
Verify Chunk Execution:

Ensure that the chunk where model_data is defined has eval = TRUE.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Setup chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE)
Copy code
Debugging:

Add a print or summary statement for model_data to verify it is correctly defined.
Example:
r
Copy code
print(head(model_data))
Use Saved Data:

If model_data is prepared in a separate script, save it as an RDS file and load it in your .qmd file.
Example:
r
Copy code
# Save model_data
saveRDS(model_data, "data/model_data.rds")

# Load model_data in the .qmd file
model_data <- readRDS("data/model_data.rds")
Test Entire Document:

Run all chunks in the .qmd file from start to finish to ensure the document runs independently without relying on objects from the global environment.

Here’s the revised code for Out-of-Sample Testing, ensuring that everything is explicitly defined and avoids issues during rendering:

Revised Code:
r
Copy code
#### Workspace Setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)

# Step 1: Load and prepare the data
analysis_data <- arrow::read_parquet("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet")

# Step 2: Select relevant columns for modeling
model_data <- analysis_data %>%
  select(
    date,
    returned_to_shelter,
    moved_to_housing,
    actively_homeless,
    newly_identified,
    ageunder16, `age16-24`, `age25-34`, `age35-44`, `age45-54`, `age55-64`, age65over,
    interaction_age_under16_time, interaction_age16_24_time, interaction_age25_34_time,
    interaction_age35_44_time, interaction_age45_54_time, interaction_age55_64_time,
    interaction_age65over_time,
    population_group_percentage
  )

# Step 3: Train-Test Split
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
train_indices <- sample(seq_len(nrow(model_data)), size = 0.7 * nrow(model_data))
train_data <- model_data[train_indices, ]
test_data <- model_data[-train_indices, ]

# Step 4: Build the Model
model_toronto <- lm(
  formula = moved_to_housing ~ 
    returned_to_shelter + 
    actively_homeless + 
    newly_identified + 
    population_group_percentage + 
    ageunder16 + `age16-24` + `age25-34` + `age35-44` + `age45-54` + `age55-64` + age65over + 
    interaction_age_under16_time + interaction_age16_24_time + interaction_age25_34_time + 
    interaction_age35_44_time + interaction_age45_54_time + interaction_age55_64_time + 
    interaction_age65over_time,
  data = train_data
)

# Step 5: Out-of-Sample Testing
# Add predictions to the test data
test_data <- test_data %>%
  mutate(predicted_moved_to_housing = predict(model_toronto, newdata = test_data))

# Compute performance metrics
r_squared <- summary(model_toronto)$r.squared
adjusted_r_squared <- summary(model_toronto)$adj.r.squared
aic <- AIC(model_toronto)
bic <- BIC(model_toronto)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((test_data$moved_to_housing - test_data$predicted_moved_to_housing)^2, na.rm = TRUE))

# Step 6: Create a Performance Table
performance_metrics <- tibble(
  Metric = c("R-squared", "Adjusted R-squared", "AIC", "BIC", "RMSE"),
  Value = c(
    round(r_squared, 3),
    round(adjusted_r_squared, 3),
    round(aic, 3),
    round(bic, 3),
    round(rmse, 3)
  )
)

# Step 7: Display Performance Table
library(knitr)
performance_metrics %>%
  kable(
    caption = "Model Performance Metrics: Out-of-Sample Testing",
    col.names = c("Metric", "Value"),
    format = "markdown"  # Change to "latex" if rendering for LaTeX
  )
Notes:
Train-Test Split:

Explicitly defines train_data and test_data without relying on external objects.
Performance Metrics:

Calculates R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, AIC, BIC, and RMSE directly in the script.
Rendering-Ready:

Avoids reliance on objects from the global environment. All required objects (model_data, train_data, and test_data) are explicitly created in the .qmd file.
Flexibility:

Easily adaptable if additional metrics or modifications are needed.
